          <p>This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations.
            It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so.
            We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all.
            Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world.
            The little tiny Tim easels will let you down.
            Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast?
            You have to make these big decisions.</p>

          <p>I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting.
            These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. Anyone can paint. This is your world.</p>

          <div class="review-body">
            <p>This addictive new horror-mystery series, which is set in the 1980s and stars a hard-working Winona Ryder, works quite well as a standalone bit of telly. But for viewers who spent formative years in the cinemas and video stores of the '80s it will bring a surprisingly poignant rush of nostalgia as it references everything from E.T. to Stand by Me by way of Poltergeist, Aliens and plenty more. The action takes place in Hawkins, Indiana, a town that's not quite the slice of Midwestern wholesomeness that it first seems. Families are strained and splintered, individuals struggle with grief and addiction, and there are some sinister things going on at a secret military research facility outside of town. The town is blown apart by the disappearance of 12-year-old Will Byers (Noah Schnapp). His distraught mother (Ryder) quickly comes to believe that Will isn't exactly dead, while his three best friends – Dungeons & Dragons nerds, naturally – resolve to help find him. <br> <br> The shocks, horror and menace come from several directions, including that of the scary scientist played by Matthew Modine. Ryder has to do some hard yakka appearing crazed by grief, fear or desperation in most of the early scenes, but that's all very much within her wheelhouse, and she produces a terrific performance full of pathos and panache. Tony Award nominee David Harbour is good as the town police chief, who is wrestling with demons of his own, but what really makes the show is the casting of the three little amigos and the strange girl who joins them on the quest to find the missing Will. Series creators Matt and Ross Duffer have keen recall and observation when it comes to the concerns and dynamics of children, and the chemistry between the young actors is a thing of beauty. From time to time in the early episodes it does feel as though Stranger Things is only a gratuitous reference or two away from tipping over into uninspired pastiche, but it has enough ballast to keep righting itself. Well worth checking out.
